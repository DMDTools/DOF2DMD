# DOF2DMD

![DOF2DMD logo](DOF2DMD-on-dmd.png)

DOF2DMD is a small utility for arcade cabinets to display game marquees, score
and animations on a real or emulated DMD device.

It covers the following use cases:

- Starting the game: showing the game marquee
- Score: showing the score for 1 up to 4 players with diferent layouts depending of the number of players
- Events: showing images, videos or gif animations based on events in the game (eg shooting down a plane in 1942 will trigger an explosion)
- Text: showing text with diferent fonts, sizes and animations based on events

DOF2DMD offers a simple HTTP API (see [API](#api)) to display pictures, animations and scores.

One big use case is to interface
[DOFLinx](https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showforum=104) and its
[modified version of MAME](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AjJ8EQo3AkmG2mw7w0fLzF9HcOjFoUZH)
from [DDH69](https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showuser=95623) to get the DMD
to show animations while playing MAME.

Here is how it looks like with an emulated DMD (using Freezy DMD extensions):

![demo](demo.gif)

DOF2DMD relies on [FlexDMD](https://github.com/vbousquet/flexdmd), which itself
uses [Freezy DMD extensions](https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions)

## Setup

- Download and install dotnet 8 "Runtime desktop" from Microsoft: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.6-windows-x64-installer
- Download DOF2DMD from [Release section](https://github.com/DMDTools/DOF2DMD/releases), create a folder and extract the content of the archive in this folder
- Tweak `settings.ini` if needed:

    ```ini
    ; Settings for DOF2DMD
    ; The base URL that DOF2DMD will listen to. Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ; DO NOT COMMENT OUT, as DOFLinx reads settings.ini to determine where to send requests to
    url_prefix=http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ; Display the score for x seconds, then back to marquee. Defaults to 5 seconds.
    ;display_score_duration_s=5
    ; Verbose output in debug.log file if debug=true. Defaults to false.
    ;debug=false
    ; Path of the artwork (relative to DOF2DMD or absolute). Defaults to "artwork"
    ;artwork_path=artwork
    ; Width in pixels for DMD. Defaults to 128
    ;dmd_width=128
    ; Height in pixels for DMD. Defaults to 32
    ;dmd_height=32
    ; Picture to display when DOF2DMD starts. Defaults to DOF2DMD (that is artwork/DOF2DMD.png or DOF2DMD.gif)
    ;start_picture=DOF2DMD
    ;Activate the autoshow of the Scoreboard or Marquee after using a call
    ;score_dmd=1
    ;marquee_dmd=1
    ; Not implemented ---
    ;scene_default=marquee
    ;number_of_dmd=1
    ;animation_dmd=1

    ```
- Launch DOF2DMD
- You should see the DOF2DMD logo, either on a Virtual DMD, or real DMD if you have configured `DmdDevice.ini`
- If using DOFLinx for MAME
  - Install [DOFLinx](https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showforum=104) - see [DOFLinx setup for DOF2DMD](#use-in-doflinx)
  - Get [modified MAME version](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AjJ8EQo3AkmG2mw7w0fLzF9HcOjFoUZH)
  - Launch DOFLinx (should be at startup if you are on an Arcade cabinet).
  - Launch your MAME game. The modified version of MAME will communicate with
    DOFLinx, which in turn will trigger API calls to DOF2DMD.
- Enjoy!

## Artwork

The images and animations must be in the `artwork` folder (by default in the DOF2DMD path under the `artwork` folder).

> [!NOTE]
> I provide a basic set of artwork, so that you can test and start editing DOFLINX's `.MAME` files.
You probably need more artwork. Do not ask me where to find artwork for the DMD. I cannot help with
that. There is however a pack you can download, and more you can buy from
[Neo-Arcadia](https://www.neo-arcadia.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=67065). If you
own a [PixelCade](https://pixelcade.org/), then you are entitled to a massive
pixel perfect DMD artwork library. To create your own artwork, you can use a 
Pixel Art tool or Gif editor, like [aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).
There are example aseprite files in [the `ingame.src` folder](/DOF2DMD/artwork/ingame.src/).

## API

DOF2DMD is a server listening to simple http request. Once it has started, you can use the following :

- `[url_prefix]/v1/display/picture?path=<image or video path>&animation=<fade|ScrollRight|ScrollLeft|ScrollUp|ScrollDown|None>&duration=<seconds>`  
  Display an image, gif animation or video.
  - **path**: The file path of the image or video to be displayed
  - **duration**: If the duration is 0 in an animation/video, it will be limited to the duration of the video or animation. If the time is -1, it will be permanent
  - **animation**: The animation applied to the scene fade|ScrollRight|ScrollLeft|ScrollUp|ScrollDown|None
- `[url_prefix]/v1/display/score?players=<number of players>&player=<active player>&score=<score>&cleanbg=<true|false>`  
  Display a score board using a layout from 1 to 4 players and credits**
  - **players**: the number of players for score layout. Optional, default 1
  - **player**: the highlighted player
  - **score**: The score value to be displayed for active player
  - **credits**: Credits inserted in the game. Optional

- `[url_prefix]/v1/exit`
  This endpoint exits or closes the application
- `[url_prefix]/v1/version`
  This endpoint returns the version information of the application
- `[url_prefix]/v1/display/text?text=<text>?size=XS|S|M|L|XL&color=<hex color>&font=<font>&bordercolor=<hex color>&bordersize=<0|1>&cleanbg=<true|false>&animation=<ScrollRight|ScrollLeft|ScrollUp|ScrollDown|None>&duration=<seconds>`  
  Display some text with or without animation

  - **duration**: time to present the text in the DMD (If an animation is selected, the screen will remain black once the animation ends if the time is longer than the animation itself. If the time is -1 in none text animation, it will be permanent, using -1 in another animation presents a black screen)
- `[url_prefix]/v1/display/advanced?path=<image or video path>&text=<text>?size=XS|S|M|L|XL&color=<hex color>&font=<font>&bordercolor=<hex color>&bordersize=<0|1>&cleanbg=<true|false>&animationin=<FadeIn|FadeOut|ScrollOffRight|ScrollOffLeft|ScrollOnLeft|ScrollOnRight|ScrollOffUp|ScrollOffDown|ScrollOnUp|ScrollOnDown|FillFadeIn|FillFadeOut|None>&animationout=<FadeIn|FadeOut|ScrollOffRight|ScrollOffLeft|ScrollOnLeft|ScrollOnRight|ScrollOffUp|ScrollOffDown|ScrollOnUp|ScrollOnDown|FillFadeIn|FillFadeOut|None>&duration=<seconds>`

## Use in DOFLinx

To generate effects, DOFLinx uses `.MAME` files located in DOFLinx's MAME
folder. DOFLinx can communicate with DOF2DMD, using DOFLinx `FF_DMD` command.
The `FF_DMD` command can call any of the DOF2DMD APIs.

### `DOFLinx.ini` file

Here is a minimal DOFLinx.ini file which will work with `DOF2DMD`:

```ini
# location of your files and systems
COLOUR_FILE=<DOFLinx path>\config\colours.ini
DIRECTOUTPUTGLOBAL=<DOFLinx path>\config\GlobalConfig_b2sserver.xml
PATH_MAME=<DOFLinx path>\MAME\
MAME_FOLDER=<MAME executable path (note: it must be DOFLinx modified MAME version)>

# When to activate, and more specifically what is the MAME process to kick things off
PROCESSES=Mame64
MAME_PROCESS=Mame64

# DOF2DMD
PATH_DOF2DMD=<location of DOF2DMD executable and settings.ini>
```

Note:

- `PATH_DOF2DMD`: the location of DOF2DMD executable and settings.ini
- `MAME_FOLDER`: MAME executable path which must be DOFLinx's [modified version of MAME](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AjJ8EQo3AkmG2mw7w0fLzF9HcOjFoUZH)

### Embedded commands

DOFLinx will generate the following commands automatically:

- When starting DOFLinx:
  - `http://<host:port>/v1/version` - to check that DOF2DMD is up. DOFLinx will attempt to start it otherwise.
  - `http://<host:port>/v1/display/picture?path=mame/DOFLinx` - to display the DOFLinx welcome picture
- When starting a game:
  - `http://<host:port>/v1/display/picture?path=mame/<rom-name>&duration=<duration>&animation=<animation>` - to display a PNG for the marquee
- When playing a game:
  - `http://<host:port>/v1/display/score?player=<active player>&score=<score>&cleanbg=<true|false>` - to display score of the given player
  - `http://<host:port>/v1/display/score?players=<number of players>&player=<active player>&score=<score>&cleanbg=<true|false>&credits=<credits>` - to display score of the given player inidicating the score board layout based on the number of players
- When closing DOFLinx:
  - `http://<host:port>/v1/display/score?player=1&score=0` - reset score to 0
  - `http://<host:port>/v1/blank` - to clear the DMD (goes to black)
  - `http://<host:port>/v1/exit` - to instruct DOF2DMD to exit cleanly

### Syntax of `FF_DMD` DOFLinx command

To add effects like showing animations or text during the game, you must insert
the `FF_DMD` command in the `<rom>.MAME` file which corresponds to the game.

```ascii
FF_DMD,U,<DOF2DMD API CALL without host nor /v1/ prefix>
```

- `FF_DMD` is the command
- `U` is for a user command (DOFLinx specific)
- Then the URI to call DOF2DMD without host nor /v1/ prefix

Examples :

- Display the ingame bonus animation `artwork/ingame/bonus.gif` : `FF_DMD,U,display/picture?path=ingame/bonus&duration=0&animation=none`
- Display a static picture `artwork/mame/pacman.png` : `FF_DMD,U,display/picture?path=mame/pacman&duration=-1`
- Display an animated Gif if it exists or falls back to png : `artwork/mame/pacman.gif` : `FF_DMD,U,display/picture?path=mame/pacman&duration=-1`

Check the `.MAME` files included in DOFLinx, which already contain `FF_DMD` commands.

## Testing

Once DOF2DMD is started, you can use your browser to test it:

- Show version [http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/version](http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/version) 
- Display picture in the artwork folder, subfolder `mame`, picture `galaga`: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/picture?path=mame/galaga&duration=-1&animation=fade](http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/picture?path=mame/galaga&duration=-1&animation=fade) 
- Set score of player 1 (default) to 1000 using default 4 player layout and cleaning the current scene: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/score?score=1000](http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/score?score=1000)
- Set score of player 2 to 3998, credits to 5 using 2 player layout over the current scene: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/scorev2?players=2&activeplayer=2&score=3998&cleanbg=false&credits=5](http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/score?players=4&player=2&score=3998&cleanbg=false&credits=5)
- Set active player to player 2 and set score to 2000 using 2 players layout cleaning the current scene: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/score?players=2&player=2&score=2000](http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/score?players=2&player=2&score=2000)
- Show text using M size with Back To the Future Font, orange font color, red border font color and scroll right animation during 10 seconds: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/text?text=HELLO|friends&font=BTTF&size=M&color=FFA500&bordersize=1&bordercolor=FF0000&cleanbg=true&animation=scrollright&duration=10](http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/text?text=HELLO|friends&font=BTTF&size=M&color=FFA500&bordersize=1&bordercolor=FF0000&cleanbg=true&animation=scrollright&duration=10)
- Show text with a background image using White Rabbit font in white and blue border using a fade animation in and a scroll right as animation out and waiting 10 seconds betwwen animations [http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/advanced?path=mame/DOFLinx&text=Hello%20Friends!!&font=WhiteRabbit&size=M&color=0000ff&bordersize=1&bordercolor=ffffFF&cleanbg=true&animationin=FadeIn&animationout=ScrollOffRight&duration=10](http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/display/advanced?path=mame/DOFLinx&text=Hello%20Friends!!&font=WhiteRabbit&size=M&color=0000ff&bordersize=1&bordercolor=ffffFF&cleanbg=true&animationin=FadeIn&animationout=ScrollOffRight&duration=10)
- Blank the DMD [http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/blank](http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/blank)
- Exit DOF2DMD [http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/exit](http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/exit)

or use the [`demo.ps1`](/DOF2DMD/demo.ps1) and [`demo2.ps1`](/DOF2DMD/demo2.ps1) PowerShell script.

## Frontends plugin

- A plugin for [Attract-Mode](https://attractmode.org/) which interfaces with DOF2DMD to show systems, game marquees and info when browsing
  games is done and can found in [Attract/DMDPlayer](https://github.com/DMDTools/DOF2DMD/tree/main/Attract/Plugins/DMDPlayer)


## TODO

Here is what I plan to implement : 

- API calls which are not implemented yet
- Everything missing from the `settings.ini`
- A plugin for [Launch box / big box](http://pluginapi.launchbox-app.com/) which
  interfaces with DOF2DMD to show systems and game marquees when browsing
  games (partially implemented)
